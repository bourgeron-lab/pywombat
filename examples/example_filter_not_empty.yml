# Example: Filter for variants with ClinVar annotations
#
# The not_empty operator filters for values that are NOT null, NOT empty string,
# and NOT "." (the standard missing value indicator in VCF/genomic files).
#
# Use case: Require that specific annotation fields have data present.
# This is the opposite of is_empty, which checks for missing/empty values.

# Require ClinVar annotation to be present
# This will only keep variants that have a value in the VEP_CLIN_SIG field
expression: "VEP_CLIN_SIG not_empty & VEP_CANONICAL = YES"

# Alternative examples (uncomment to use):

# Require both ClinVar and LoF annotations to be present
# expression: "VEP_CLIN_SIG not_empty & VEP_LoF not_empty & VEP_IMPACT = HIGH"

# Variants with annotations that passed gnomAD filters
# (combining not_empty and is_empty operators)
# expression: "VEP_CLIN_SIG not_empty & genomes_filters is_empty"

# Filter for variants that FAILED gnomAD filters (have filter flags)
# expression: "genomes_filters not_empty & fafmax_faf95_max_genomes < 0.001"

# Comparison: is_empty vs not_empty
# - genomes_filters is_empty    -> variants that PASSED filters (no flags)
# - genomes_filters not_empty   -> variants that FAILED filters (have flags)
# - VEP_CLIN_SIG not_empty      -> variants with ClinVar annotations
# - VEP_LoF not_empty           -> variants with Loss-of-Function predictions
